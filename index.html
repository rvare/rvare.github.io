        <h2>Favorite Quotes</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Do you ask what is the proper limit to wealth? It is, first, to have what is necessary, and, second,
                to have what is enough.
                <br/><i>Seneca</i>
            </p>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                If people never did silly things nothing intelligent would ever get done.
